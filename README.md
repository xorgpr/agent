### Steps to running Gemini CLI with devconatiner.
1. Run this repo in your Codespaces (for github) or run it in the devcontainer locally (docker should be installed on your PC)

2. Import your gemini API key from https://aistudio.google.com/apikey

    ```
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="xxx"
    ```

3. To run gemini:
    ```bash
    npx https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
    ```

If you see any errors during installation, just update the dependencies that will be specified in the error description (for example, `npm`).
This is normal, as this is a stock image, which gives it a lot of pre-installed software, but it is not updated often.
